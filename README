This is a fork of Florian Paul Schmidt's project on Sourceforge ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/scgraph/ ). Feel free to contribute/report bugs/fork here as the original project is "Abandonware" and Sourceforge is ugly. 

The goal of this fork is to make it usable with SuperCollider 3.5 and finally expand SuperCollider's supremacy from the audio programming language universe to the realm of visuals.

There is a mailing list on Sourceforge ( http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=scgraph-users ), where the forkee is also subscribed, perhaps it could be re-activated.

Thanks for listening. Original README follows after 79 dashes and one point.

- What is ScGraph?

 ScGraph is a graphics server following the SuperCollider3 OSC interface. Albeit with a changed semantics. Here's quick example code:


// We "boot" the server first [we have to trick SuperCollider into thinking
// the server runs remotely, so it doesn't spawn a local one.
a = NetAddr("192.168.1.8", 37291);
s = Server.new (\scgraph, a)
Server.default = s;

// Then we produce a SynthDef (a Synthesizer Definition) and send it to the 
// server
(
	SynthDef (
		\WobblingCube,
		{
			Out.gr (0, Cube.ar (size: SinOsc.kr (freq: 0.5)));
		}
	).store;
)

// Tell the server to produce one instance of this Definition
a.sendMsg("/s_new", "WobblingCube", -1, 0, 0);

 This little example produces a cube in the origin which bouces about all three axes with a frequency of 0.5Hz. Ok, you don't see anything you say? Oh well try this:

(
	SynthDef (
		\SimpleView,
		{
			GGLRenderer.gr (In.ar (0));
		}
	).store;
)

a.sendMsg("/s_new", "SimpleView", -1, 1, 0);

 This Synth reads from the Graphics bus 0 and uses the GGLRenderer Ugen to produce an output window showing the graphics object on the bus. Note the third argument to /s_new in the latter example. It indicates that the SimpleView is put at the tail of group 0, while the Synth above was put to the head. 

 If you want to know what kind of new units are supported, have look into either the class browser (all graphical units start with a capital "G") or into
