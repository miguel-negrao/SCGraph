- Requirements:

 - Qt 4.2+          (http://trolltech.com)
 - SuperCollider 3.5 (http://supercollider.sf.net) - You need a build with development files installed.
 - Boost            (http://www.boost.org/)
 - pkg-config       (http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/)
 - Pthreads         (http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)
 - SndFile          (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)

 Most of these should be available in all major linux distros. 

- Mac OS X

 On Mac OS X you will have to do some tracking down and installing.

- Optional Dependencies

 If you want the JackClient (which can do fft analysis of audio input over a jack port), then you need:

 - JACK             (http://jackaudio.org)
 - FFTW3            (http://www.fftw.org/)


- How to build

 If you installed any of the required packages from source, make sure that pkg-config finds the respective .pc file (e.g. for libsndfile and jack) by virtue of the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.
 E. g. if you are on Mac OS X and use homebrew, make sure it's set to:
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

 The build system uses cmake, so:

 mkdir build
 cd build/ && cmake ..
 make

- Caveats

 If the SuperCollider sources are not found, make sure to set SC_PATH e. g. with ccmake:
 
 cd build/ && ccmake ..

 Currently the linking doesn't work right on Mac OS X, so libscsynth is not found by the binary if it is run standalone. It works if you start the server from within sclang (with the GServer class). If you want to run it standalone anyways, you can fix this with:

 install_name_tool -change libscsynth.1.dylib /Applications/SuperCollider/libscsynth.1.dylib path/to/scgraph
 
- What to do if the build succeeded?

  - Add the 

    $(PREFIX)/share/scgraph/sclang

    to your sclang.cfg, so the classes get loaded in your SuperCollider installation.

  - create a directory

    $(HOME)/.scgraph/synthdefs

    and

    $(HOME)/.scgraph/textures

    and 

    $(HOME)/.scgraph/textures/default/

  - Have a look at the examples in 

    $(PREFIX)/share/doc/examples/

    They show you how to make simple animations with scgraph.


Have fun,
